Airplanes Project

Makers Academy week 3 test (Architect Project)

The task was as follows...

    "Imagine you're writing software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off."

The project was written in Ruby, using Sublime Text Editor and RSpec was used throughout!
